Pricing and process
=====================
Because editing, writing and translating vary in complexity based on the subject, the format, the audience, your preferences and possibly the 
quality of the original, giving price ranges is hard. I prefer to work with hourly rates, set on a sliding scale to reflect the nature of the job, 
the nature of the client and how much I like the offered work. The non-profit asking me to write little biographies for their shelter dogs 
will be quoted a lower rate than the tech company that wants me to set up the user documentation for their newest app.  

Because a successful contracting experience hinges on setting proper expectations, I would also like to outline what you 
can expect when you choose to work with me.

Any job of reasonable size (estimated work time eight hours or more) will look like this:
 
-	We assess the job and determine the rate.
-	I issue a formal work summary and quote.
-	You approve the work summary and assignment.
-	I deliver a first sample for your approval.
-	You give feedback on the sample.
-	You pay 50% of the expected end price.
-	I deliver 50% of the task, based on your feedback.
-	We assess any changes in expected work duration and I incorporate further feedback you have.
-	I deliver the full job and send you an itemized bill.
-	You pay the billed amount minus your prior payment. 
-	Edits or changes that you request after completion will be billed against the same rate as agreed upon in the quote.

For smaller jobs and repeat customers we can work out a quicker process, of course.
