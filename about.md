My name is Maria and I am a wordaholic. The second word I learned to say, was 'book'. In primary school I published my own newspaper, typing out multiple copies of the front page article about a kidnapped lady bug on a cast iron typewriter. As a high school student I volunteered as a journalist for a local 'street news' newspaper, wrote short stories and participated in online English language lyric writing contests. 

After graduating from high school I briefly pursued a career as an illustrative artist, but I decided soon that I preferred the 
world of the word. While working a variety of jobs, I spent my evenings studying to become a translator at ITV Hogeschool voor 
Tolken en Vertalen (ITV College for Interpreting and Translation). Soon thereafter I decided to commit to studying full time. 
At Utrecht University I first obtained a Bachelor's degree and eventually graduated with an MA in Literatuurwetenschap (Literary 
Studies). An internship during my studies lead to my first job in the publishing world, writing and editing copy for a variety 
of textbooks, exams and assessments.

Before, after and alongside my work in instructional design and educational publishing I have always taken on different freelance 
projects. I have edited texts such as graduate and undergraduate level theses, graduate school admissions essays, resumes and 
commercial website copy. As a translator I have worked on projects such as short stories, speeches and user interface text for 
online applications. Aside from my professional language activities, I continue to write for my own enjoyment.
